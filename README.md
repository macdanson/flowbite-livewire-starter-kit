## Laravel + Flowbite+ Livewire Starter Kit
# Introduction
Our [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) + [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/) + [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/quickstart) starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a Livewire frontend using Flowbite - Tailwind CSS component library unlike the official Livewire starter kit.

I was heavily inspired by [the official Livewire Starter Kit](https://github.com/laravel/livewire-starter-kit) and [Flowbite - Tailwind CSS component library](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/)

## Installation

Installation can be done by laravel installer.

```bash
laravel new test-app --using macdanson/flowbite-livewire-starter-kit
```

## Official Documentation

1. Documentation for all Laravel starter kits can be found on the [Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits).
2. Get started with the most popular open-source library of interactive UI components built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS at [Flowbite - Tailwind CSS component library](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/).
